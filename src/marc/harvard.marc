The theatre was a venue primarily for burlesque, variety, continental operetta and light comedy under the management of Hollingshead from 1868 to 1886.  aCostume designs by Alfred Thompson in watercolor and ink for shows mounted at the Gaiety Theatre (London, England) ca. 1870-1875, some with contemporary and/or later manuscript annotations.  aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02082  aAlfred Thompson Costume Designs (MS Thr 583).

He spent most of the next two decades at various institutions in England, continental Europe, and India. He studied theology and ecclesiastical history at Oxford and Cambridge, followed by ancient and medieval history and philology at the Universities of Strassburg and Berlin. After completing his Ph.D. studies in Germany, he returned to Harvard and spent two years teaching as an Instructor of Anthropology and Philosophy. He developed an interest in Indic philosophy, which led him back to Europe to study under Paul Deussen (1845-1919), one of the founders of Indic studies in Europe. After further study in India at Benares and in Kashmir, he returned to Harvard in 1903 and was appointed to the Department of Philosophy, first as Instructor, and then Professor of the Philosophical Systems of India. He remained in the department until his retirement in 1934. During this time, he served as the Chair of the Division and Department of Philosophy from 1915-18, 1920-27, and 1930-33. He published numerous translations of Pali and Sanskrit scriptures, as well as works of secondary scholarship.  aWoods's interest in Buddhism led him into the study of East Asia, and he made several extended trips to Japan during his years on the Harvard faculty. He actively promoted the development of academic positions dedicated to the study of East Asia. He also worked to establish a permanent chair in Chinese, which was first filled by Chao Yuen Ren in 1922. His greatest success, however, came from working in tandem with Wallace Donham and others to secure funding from the estate of Charles Hall for the founding of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, for which he served as a trustee. Although Woods passed away before the Department of Far Eastern Languages was established, he helped to provide the institutional and intellectual backing that became the framework for its success.  aLetters and a document sent to James Haughton Woods, professor of philosophy at Harvard University, with a few letters between others collected by him.  aIncludes T.

Wilson in association with Donald H. Coleman and the Theatre Corporation of American (of which Coleman was president); with costumes by Miles White; lighting by Peggy Clark; production design by Oliver Smith; and C. Edwin Knill was general manager. With Tallulah Bankhead starring, the play opened in Philadelphia at the Forrest Theatre (Organization : Philadelphia, Pa.), then in New York on January 30, 1957, at the Ambassador Theatre (Organization : New York, N.Y.), where 12 performances were staged before it closed February 9.  aThe short run of the play, according to John C. Wilson's account sent to investors, was due in part to Tallulah Bankhead's suffering a number of injuries and illnesses before and during the play's run and in part to its mixed reviews. In 1958, Donald H.

Correspondence; and II. Documents and notes.  aLouis Prang (1824-1909) was a lithographer, wood engraver, and educator from Breslau (Germany) and Boston (Mass.). With Julius Meyer, he founded the lithographic business of Prang & Meyer in 1856 which later became L. Prang & Co. Prang reproduced paintings by noted 19th century artists and introduced the Christmas card in the 1870s. He is considered the founder of the greeting card business in the U.S. Prang retired from business in 1899 and died ten years later in a California sanitarium.  aThe reasons for Prang's interest in gold mining and its processes are uncertain; it was certainly a business and investment opportunity. Prang may also have been interested in the gold for its use in ink; one of his partners in the venture, Henry B. Davis, was an officer of the Dando Printing Company of Philadelphia, a printer of elaborate stock certificates. The venture may have been called Monitor Concentrator and Amalgamator, as evidenced by receipts.  aThe collection is comprised of correspondence (including telegrams), receipts, patent documents, and notes concerning Prang's investment and scientific interest in a gold separation process utilizing mining tailings. The correspondence includes detailed reports on gold mines in California and Nova Scotia, discussions of gold concentrators, chlorination, transport of ore to the eastern United States, and business arrangements; correspondents include geographer and geologist William Morris Davis. Documents include receipts and invoices for supplies and services connected with expeditions in 1888 to California. Also included is a receipt for Prang's patent for a separator.  aIn English.  aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02399  aRecords Concerning Louis Prang's Gold Mining Venture, 1887-1890 (MS Am 2768).

In 18th century Boston, two taverns stood side by side on Washington Street, the Lamb Tavern adjoined the south side of the Lion Tavern. By 1835, the Lion Tavern was gone, and its site became the first within the block to be used for theatrical purposes. (The Lamb Tavern, then kept by Laban Adams, was replaced by a hotel, the Adams House, by the end of the 1850’s). The orchestra or pit of the Lion Theatre was a ring for equestrian performances extending under three shallow tiers of boxes. During the summer of 1836 the wooden front building was replaced by a brick building with first-floor stores, its upper rooms later absorbed in the Adams house. The Lion Theatre was refitted in 1839 as the Mechanics Institute, a lecture and concert hall.  aIn 1840, The Vaudeville Saloon (formerly Boylston Hall) advertised for a variety program, called vaudeville, which is thought to be the first use of the word vaudeville in the United States. This hall was located on the southwest corner of Boylston and Washington Streets.  aAll items are in unidentified manuscript hand probably written (or copied) after 1909.

Inspired by a solar eclipse in 1806, Bond soon thereafter became an avid amateur astronomer; he rebuilt the parlor of his first house as an observatory. Bond traveled to Europe in 1815, commissioned by Harvard University to gather information on European observatories. In 1839, Bond was allowed to move his personal astronomical equipment to Harvard and serve as its (unpaid) "Astronomical Observer to the University." By 1843, a sun-grazing comet having aroused public interest in astronomy, Harvard was able to raise money for the construction of a state-of-the-art observatory. Bond designed the building and the observing chair, and Harvard bought a fifteen-inch German-built refracting telescope, equal in size to the largest in the world at the time. The telescope was first used in 1847 when it was pointed to the moon. Bond and his son, George Phillips Bond, discovered Saturn's moon Hyperion, were the first to observe the then innermost ring of Saturn in 1850, and helped pioneer astrophotography.  aBond married his first cousin, Selina Cranch, in 1819; they had four sons and two daughters. After Selina's death in 1831, Bond married her older sister, Mary Roope Cranch.  aScience-related correspondence of William Cranch Bond concerning various astronomical, meteorological, and technological issues, often involving sharing of data between observatories and individual scientists. Includes a few letters written between others and printed items. All letters are autograph manuscript unless otherwise noted.  aBond family papers and records of the Harvard College Observatory are held by the Harvard University Archives.  aIn English.  aWilliam Cranch Bond Correspondence, 1840-1852 (MS Am 2805).

He was the only son and third child of Samuel Whitbread (1720-1796), brewer and politician, and his first wife, Harriet, daughter of William Hayton, attorney, of Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire. When the Drury Lane Theatre burned down in 1809, theater owner Richard Brinsley Sheridan was financially ruined. Sheridan turned to his old friend Samuel Whitbread to head a committee that would manage the company, deal with the theater's complex debts, and oversee the rebuilding. Whitbread asked Sheridan to withdraw from management himself, which he did entirely by 1811. Thomas Shaw (ca. 1760-ca. 1830) was one of the many claimants against the management of the Drury Lane Theatre.  aAutograph manuscript letters related to Thomas Shaw's dispute with the management of the Drury Lane Theatre.

There were as many as four hundred tent companies touring when the practice peaked around 1920. Typically, these shows featured a three-act comedy or drama interspersed with "polite" vaudeville. Great emphasis was placed upon presenting inoffensive family entertainment; the master of ceremonies frequently boasted that "nothing would be seen or heard that might offend the taste of the most fastidious." Tent shows often offered a repertoire of from three to twelve plays. They reached their peak activity shortly before the Great Depression.  aIncludes: photographs, playbills, and programs.

After their marriage, the couple moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts so Forceythe could oversee the education of his brother Augustus while at Harvard College (AB 1869). The couple had a son "Little Dolfi", who died after birth on June 1, 1864. Elizabeth, always in poor health, died shortly later at age 22 on October 13, 1864.  aByron Forceythe Willson was born in 1837 in Little Genessee, New York, and lived in Maysville and Covington, Kentucky and New Albany, Indiana. Forceythe attended Antioch College in Ohio, and Harvard University, but did not received degrees from either. He became an editorial writer for the Louisville Journal where he often defended the Union cause in the Civil War. He published some of his early poetry in the Louisville Journal, including his most famous work, The old Sergeant. This was reprinted privately in 1866 and then by Ticknor and Fields in Boston in 1867 as The old sergeant and other poems. Forceythe believed the living could communicate with the dead and that he was a medium through which this could be accomplished; many persons later observed him supposedly having conversations with the spirit of his dead wife. On February 2, 1867, at age 29, Forceythe died of a hemorrhage of the lung from tuberculosis. Both Elizabeth and Forceythe are buried in Conwell Cemetery in Laurel, Indiana.  aWhen these papers were purchased in 1949, it was thought that they were only the papers of Elizabeth Conwell Smith Willson. However, upon more detailed examination during full cataloging in 2012, it has been discovered that the texts of some of the poems were published as the work of Forceythe Willson in his 1867 book The old sergeant and other poems. Consequently the repository has only assigned an author to an item, if it is signed by the maker, or if the title appeared in the 1867 volume. Further study by readers is suggested.8 aThe collection includes autograph manuscripts of Elizabeth Willson's poems and essays and manuscripts of Forceythe Willson's poems. Includes what appears to be the printers' copy for The Crown of Love, which is marked as "privately printed in 1867." Also includes a portrait carte-de-visite photograph each of Elizabeth Conwell Smith Willson and Forceythe Willson.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02382  aElizabeth Conwell Smith Willson Papers, 1857-1867 (MS Am 1168).

Miscellany, 1866-1867.  aHenry Stone (1830-1896) received an AB from Bowdoin College in 1852 and became employed at the State of Maine, a Portland newspaper. In 1857 he moved to New York City and worked for the American Railway Journal and the New York Evening Post. In 1861 he moved to Wisconsin, and shortly after was commissioned 2nd lieutenant in the 1st Wisconsin Volunteers. In April 1863 he was appointed assistant adjutant general in the United States Volunteers, with a rank of captain, and was assigned to duty in Washington D.C. In February of 1864, he was placed on the staff of General George H. Thomas and took part in all the battles of the Atlanta campaign, as well as that at Nashville. In January 1865, he received a commission as lieutenant colonel of the 100th Regiment of the United States Colored Infantry. At the end of the war Stone settled in Nashville, Tennessee and became a member of the Radical Republican Party, known as "Radicals." In August of 1866, Stone was appointed Superintending Commissioner of the Nashville Tennessee Metropolitan Police. He held this position until November of 1869. [See finding aid for additional biographical details].  aThe widely varied materials in this collection all pertain to Henry Stone's involvement in the Reconstruction period in Nashville, Tennessee. The Correspondence series (1866-1867) is primarily letters to Henry Stone concerning military matters, police concerns, and Stone's investment problems. The Documents series (1863-1869) is a varied group of materials including printed and manuscript items: miscellaneous discharge documents from the United States Army in which Colonel Henry Stone was somehow involved; special orders; abstract of articles received from citizens in the field; application for bounty money; a promissory note; and various other documents related to the military from the Union side of the American Civil War. There are additional materials including: manuscript receipts relating to a business venture (in which Henry Stone was involved) entitled Butler's Landing Oil & Mining Company; receipts issued by the State Central Committee of the Repulbican Pary of Tennessee, for funds for campaigns expended by Henry Stone, treasurer; and draft payroll records for the Metropolitan Police, District of Tennessee from 1867 October- 1869 November.

He joined with William Lloyd Garrison and others to establish the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832. He was the new organization's president and the first roving lecturer. By the late 1830s he broke with Garrison, and with James G. Birney founded the Liberty Party in 1840.

C. in 1824, the 4th of 10 children, son of Peter Force (the city's mayor, editor, and collector of rare materials) and Hannah Evans Force. He received an AB from Harvard College in 1845 and an L.LB. in 1848 from Harvard Law School. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio to begin his law practice with the law partnership of Walker, Kebler & Force. While a young lawyer in Cincinnati, Force became one of the closest friends of future president, Rutherford B. Hayes. Both men were members of the Literary Club of Cincinnati. Manning Force's wife was Frances Dabney Horton Force and they had one child, Horton Caumont Force (b. 1878; AB Harvard 1901). During the Civil War, Force became a major of the 20th Ohio Volunteer Infantry serving with General James B. McPherson's 17th Corps and rose to the rank of Brevet Major-General by the end of the war. He later received the Medal of Honor for his service. After the war he returned to Cincinnati to continue the practice of law and later became a justice of the Superior Court of Cincinnati and wrote several law books. He also served as a professor at the Cincinnati law School. Force also had a passionate interest in historical matters, writing on subjects such as the Indian mound builders of Ohio. Later in life he was appointed as commandant of the Ohio Soldiers' Home in Sandusky, Ohio, where, many years later, he died at the age of 74.  aCollection includes: Force's autograph manuscript notes (and some by his brother William Quereau Force (1820-1880)); prints of Native American drawings issued by the Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences; manuscript maps of early Illinois; and M.

He was awarded the A.B. in 1914 and the LL.B. in 1917, both from Harvard. While an undergraduate in Professor Frederick J. Turner's course entitled "History of the West," he began a study of the migration of Americans to Canada and the reverse migration from Canada to the United States. In 1915 he received a small grant to allow continuation of the study. During this time, he visited state immigration bureaus in Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, and Wisconsin as well as Dominion and Provincial and Canadian Pacific Railway immigration offices in Canada. After receiving his law degree, Staples moved to Providence, Rhode Island where he joined the law firm of Tillinghast, Collins, and Tanner. In 1925 he was appointed Fourth Assistant Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island. He later returned to Tillinghast, Collins, and Tanner, becoming a partner in 1926. He was active in many civic organizations, including the American Council for Nationalities Service where he was a director. The Council was interested in all aspects of immigration and resettlement.  aIncludes typescript letters to Harold E. Staples responding to his inquiries concerning emigration and immigration. Letters are from the U.S. Dept. of Labor, the Minnesota State Board of Immigration, Canada Dept. of the Interior, and the Alberta Dept. of Agriculture. The collection also contains papers assembled by Staples for his research, including typescript tables and charts, autograph manuscript notes, clippings, and other papers. Papers chiefly concern emigration and immigration between the U.S. and Canada, 1890-1915; and the acquisition of farm land by Americans in Canada and by Canadians in the United States, notably in Alberta and Minnesota; also contains a history of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02416  aHarold E.

Campton authored works for adult, youth and children’s theatre as well as radio and television productions. In addition to one-act plays and sketches, Campton penned full length plays, literary adaptations, and the text, Becoming a Playwright. Born in Leicester, England to parents David and Emily Campton on June 5, 1929, Campton first received recognition as a playwright in 1950 when his play Going Home was performed by an amateur theatre company. In 1955, Campton met producer Stephen Joseph who would go on to produce Dragons are Dangerous, considered Campton’s break-through work. One of the first British playwrights to embrace the style known as the Theatre of the Absurd, Campton received numerous honors throughout his career, including the British Arts Council Bursary for Playwriting in 1957 and the British Theatre Association Meyer-Whitworth Prize for Everybody’s Friend (1975), After Midnight, Before Dawn (1978), and Mrs. Meadowsweet (1985).  aIncludes 2 letters to Kristin Morrison from Campton and 1 letter to Morrison from Stephen Joseph, 2 printed plays and 2 bound typescripts by Campton, and clippings and tickets.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02110  aDavid Campton Papers (MS Thr 618).

Inspired by historical events, it incorporated music and pageantry, usually for outdoor performance. The Louisiana Cavalier was one of Green's outdoor play dramas. It was produced by the Louisiana Outdoor Drama Association and opened in the Grand Ecore Ampitheatre at Natches, Louisiana on June 16, 1976 and ran until 1979.

Bruce Berry (1924-1998) was a comic book illustrator and inker, born in Oakland, California. He served in World War II in the Air Force as a sign painter. After World War II he became involved with science fiction fandom having met Richard Kyle in Oakland, but mainly made his living as a merchandise artist, what he called a "hard-lines artist." He moved to Chicago in the 1950s, where he continued working in advertising becoming a one-man studio doing art, paste-ups, photo-retouching and finished layouts from a free-lance art director's roughs. At the end of the 1950s he illustrated "Imagination" for the last year of its existence, one of the last of the old pulp science-fiction magazines. After this he began work on comic fanzines, and then in the late 1960s he returned to California, but to Los Angeles this time. Berry inked much of Jack Kirby's 1970s work for DC comics. He sometimes used the name Morgan Drake.  aIncludes 4 signed images of space ships, both drawings and paintings, by D. Bruce Berry.

Compositions; II. Photographs; III. Other materials; IV. Correspondence; V. Printed materials.  aScreenwriter, playwright, novelist, and child actress Corinne Anita Loos was born in Sissons (now Mount Shasta), California on April 26, 1893. In 1912, she began her career as a screenwriter at D.W. Griffith’s Biograph Company, where she wrote over 100 scenarios. She married and divorced her first husband, Frank Pallma, Jr. in 1915 and was remarried to director, producer and writer John Emerson in 1920 until his death in 1956. Between 1916 and 1917, Loos formed a unit within the Biograph Company, with Emerson and actor Douglas Fairbanks, collaborating on ten films. She continued to collaborate with Emerson as a co-writer from 1916 to 1934 and as a co-producer beginning in 1919. Between 1916 and 1925, Loos worked extensively with silent film stars Norma and Constance “Dutch” Talmadge, and became close friends with their family, including their sister, Natalie Talmadge (wife of Buster Keaton), and their mother, Margaret “Peg” Talmadge. In 1919, Loos left the Griffith studio to go to New York with Emerson and work for the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. It was during this time that she wrote the bestselling novel, Gentlemen prefer blondes: the illuminating diary of a professional lady (1925). Loos returned to Hollywood in 1932 to work as a screenwriter for MGM, before returning to New York in 1943 to write and adapt scripts for the stage. In 1949, she adapted Gentlemen prefer blondes: the illuminating diary of a professional lady with playwright Joseph Fields, and it was later popularized in the film version of the stage musical starring Marilyn Monroe (1953). Loos died in New York City on August 18, 1981.2 aThe collection, consisting mainly of personal photographs of Anita Loos and the Talmadge family, covers the time period 1917 to 1979. The bulk of the collection is a series of photographs made up of photographs of Anita Loos, including pages from her personal photo album, photographs of the Talmadge family, and photographs collected by Anita Loos. The majority of the photographs were used in her memoirs: A girl like I: an autobiography, Kiss Hollywood good-by, and The Talmadge girls: a memoir. Some prominent persons depicted in photographs include: John Emerson, Douglas Fairbanks, Buster Keaton, Constance Talmadge, Margaret L. Talmadge, Natalie Talmadge, and Norma Talmadge. Also includes three typescript copies of Anita Loos’s scripts, The duel and The king’s mare; film review by poet and contributor to the New Republic, Vachel Lindsay; letter from Ralph L. Schroeder to Anita Loos regarding his Lindsay biography; letters from Jule Styne to Anita Loos regarding Anita Loos and Joseph A. Field's adaptation of her novel into the Broadway musical, Gentlemen prefer blondes; letter from Robert D. Loomis to Anita Loos concerning Jule Styne’s 1978 biography and a typed synopsis of the book; program of The constant wife and a Christmas card from actress Elsa Maxwell.  aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02242  aAnita Loos Papers, 1917-1979 (MS Thr 722).

In the early part of her career she performed a great deal of comic opera, operetta, and musical theatre. Around 1904 due to vocal issues she switched to more dramatic roles and eventually retired in 1914.

In Mazeppa she not only played the role of a man, but rode in on a horse wearing a flesh-colored body stocking to appear naked to the audience. Her lifestyle of outrageous behavior, multiple marriages, and rumored lovers was deemed very scandalous at the time. Menken desired to be a poet and was friendly with a number of literary greats including Charles Dickens, Algernon Swinburne, and George Sand.

After the Thrales were introduced to Samuel Johnson in 1765, their home became the center of an important coterie of literary, artistic, and political figures. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) was one of the leading literary figures of eighteenth-century England. He is best remembered for compiling the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language, published in 1755. He was memorialized in James Boswell’s The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791). Anna Seward (1747-1809) was an English Romantic poet.  aPredominately letters written by Hester Lynch Piozzi to her friends after the death of her husband and banishment from the artistic world. Piozzi writes to her friends and family mourning her old age and loss of artistic stimulation since her scandalous marriage to Gabriele Mario Piozzi (1740-1809) in the midst of Napoleonic Wars hardships. Includes sympathy notes, gossip, requests for literature, and bill payments on past homesteads. Also includes letters from Samuel Johnson and Anna Seward to friends and family discussing poor health and its negative effects on their work.  aMaterials predominately in English.

Correspondence with Stewart Hall Holbrook; and II. Compositions and research materials.  aHolbrook (1893-1964) was a lumberjack, journalist, and popular historian. He was born in Newport, Vermont, but spent much of his adult life living in Portland, Oregon. Holbrook's first book, Holy old Mackinaw: A natural history of the American lumberjack, was one of his most successful works. Published by Macmillan Company in 1938, the book focused on the lives of lumbermen, their work methods, and their culture and folklore. This book spent over five months on the national bestseller list and this success convinced Holbrook to move to Cambridge, Massachusetts in July of 1938, a place he felt was "more fitting for such a prominent literary figure as himself." While back East, he wrote five more books he would call "low-brow history," but he returned to Portland in 1943. He went on to write dozens of books, including the topics of Ethan Allen, the railroads, the timber industry, the Wobblies, eccentrics of the Pacific Northwest, and for over thirty years he wrote for the Oregonian.

While at Harvard, Raisbeck was an assistant to (and later a good friend of) George Pierce Baker for his 47 Workshop play writing course and a close friend of American novelist Thomas Wolfe. Raisbeck was said to be openly homosexual while at Harvard. In 1926, Raisbeck toured Paris with Wolfe and other friends, Marjorie Crocker Fairbanks (Mrs. Sydney Fairbanks) and Miss Helen Harding. Raisbeck became a playwright and screenwriter and lived in various locations in the United States. His plays consisted of Torches (1923), Rock Me, Julie which played for two weeks on Broadway in New York City (1931), and The lady of [in?] Spain which was never produced. Late in the 1920s he worked on screenplay scenarios in Hollywood and in 1931 he came East again. He was found dead in a Westport, Connecticut cemetery on September 30, 1931. Establishing the cause of death developed into a controversy, but many said he was murdered by strangulation. The killer was never found.  aRaisbeck was the model for the character Frank Starwick in Wolfe's second autobiographical novel, Of time and the river. Marjorie Crocker Fairbanks was a close friend of Raisbeck, and for a time, the wife of Sydney Van Kleek Fairbanks (1895-1985, Harvard (Class of 1917) A.B. 1920, JD 1925, AM 1933, PhD 1936). Austen Crocker Fairbanks was their child.  aPapers include: letters from Raisbeck to his friend, Marjorie Crocker Fairbanks, and her husband Sydney Fairbanks, and child Austen Fairbanks; a few letters from Marjorie Fairbanks to Raisbeck; drafts of Raisbeck's plays: The lady of Spain.

During this time, Rudolf von Laban and Mary Wigman laid the foundations for the development of modern dance. Laban had schools located throughout Germany; his schools and style are considered influential in early twentieth century modern dance education.  aThis collection contains photographs from various schools of modern dance also including schools of movement and gymnastics. The time span (1923-1931) covered in the collection provides a glimpse into a developmental period in German body culture, the ideals of which include grace, strength, and natural physical beauty through movement and exercise.8 aStudents of Rudolf von Laban and future teachers themselves included in this collection are Mary Wigman and Margarete Schmidts.

This group was also known as Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women and later known as Women’s Anti-Suffrage Association of Massachusetts.  aThe parent association encouraged local groups to form and the Newton Branch Committee was formed by Newton resident Harriet Hodges Stone (Mrs. Lincoln R. Stone). Her husband, Lincoln Ripley Stone (born 1833 in Maine), was a physician with offices in Newton. Harriet Stone was born in October of 1834 in Salem, Massachusetts, and after marriage was identified in the census as "keeping house."  aCorrespondence concerns the business of the Newton Branch and also of the larger Association, primarily with Harriet H. Stone and Helen Mansfield. Compositions include journal entries made by Stone about her daily activities for the Association ca.1898, manuscript lists of names contacted for the group, receipts, and other materials. Also includes leather wallets used to house diaries.

Her son by her first marriage, John Marshall Clemens (1798-1847), was the father of American author Samuel Langhorne Clemens (Mark Twain). Her children by her second marriage were: Ann Hill Hancock, Mary G. Hancock, Pamelia G. Hancock, and a son whose name is unknown. Ann Hill Hancock married William H. Saunders of England; they had a daughter, Mary Ann Pamela Xantippe (Tippy) and a son, James Saunders. When Ann died (ca. 1841) William Saunders married her sister, Mary G. Hancock. Mary Hancock Saunders is said to be the inspiration for her nephew Mark Twain's "Aunt Polly" in The adventures of Tom Sawyer. Pamelia and Simon Hancock's son (name unknown) was the father of Elsie Hancock, the donor, Paul E. Carrico's aunt.  aCorrespondence of Hancock family members including two letters from John Marshall Clemens to his mother Pamelia (Goggin) Clemens Hancock as well as letters from Elsie Hancock to Paul E.

Ticknor and Fields originated in the firm of Allen and Ticknor established in 1832. The partners in Ticknor and Fields were William D. Ticknor (one of the partners in Allen and Ticknor) and James T. Fields, who entered the firm as a junior partner in 1843. Fields edited the Atlantic Monthly from 1861-1870. Fields was also a writer; his writings include: Poems (1849), Yesterdays with authors (1872), and Hawthorne (1876). In 1854, Fields married Annie Adams, an author, literary hostess, and social welfare worker. Ticknor and Fields became Fields, Osgood and Co. in 1868 when James R. Osgood joined the firm. After a series of changes, Fields, Osgood and Co. evolved into Houghton, Mifflin and Company.  aPrimarily correspondence of James Thomas Fields, along with the correspondence of James R. Osgood and other Ticknor and Fields editors. Correspondents include Louis Agassiz, Lydia Maria Francis Child, George William Curtis, and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, among other nineteenth-century literary figures. Some letters include cartes-de-visite of the correspondent. There is a small amount of correspondence among Ticknor and Fields authors as well as letters from Annie Fields. Compositions include autograph manuscript poems by Annie Fields, print and autograph manuscript poems by James Thomas Fields, and a partial autograph manuscript of George Stillman Hillard's Six months in Italy, among other items. Finally, there are royalty checks to various Ticknor and Fields authors, visiting cards of James Thomas Fields, and a cabinet photograph of an unidentified man.  aTicknor and Fields Records (MS Am 2100).

During the years 1964 and 1965 Copland wrote, conducted, narrated, and hosted a series of twelve television programs entitled "Music in the 20s." The typscripts described in this collection were transcribed from filmed interviews that were recorded live at the WGBH studios in Boston, Mass. between 1964 Nov. 11 and 1965 Jan. 26. These unedited, preliminary interviews later formed the basis of the series of twelve half-hour television shows created by WGBH (Television station : Boston, Mass.). The shows were broadcast during 1965-1966, over the National Educational Television network of more than 90 affiliated educational TV stations in the United States.  aTypescript mimeograph copies of transcripts of twelve informal, unedited, script conference interviews with Aaron Copland, held at the WGBH TV studios in Boston, Massachusetts. These transcripts include what is called "Copland's text," as well as pre- and post-session conversations.  aThe topics of the transcripts concern all variety of issues and personalities in the field of western music in the decade of the 1920s. Prominent persons discussed are: Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Arthur Honegger, George Gershwin, and many others. Included in this discussion is the role of jazz.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou017788 aUnpublished printed finding aid available in the Houghton Accessions Records, 1965-1966, under *65M-94 (1-12).  aAaron Copland Transcripts for Music in the 20s (MS Am 2377).

Part of his personal collection of Americana was bought by Israel Thorndike and presented to Harvard College in 1818. William Bentley (1759-1819) was an American Unitarian minister, scholar, columnist, and diarist. He received an AB from Harvard College in 1777. Bentley amassed a library of over 4,000 volumes, one of the largest private libraries in America at the time.  a42 autograph manuscript letters, in English, (signed by Ebeling) to William Bentley; also with 3 letters to Ebeling from Nathaniel Silsbee, Van Staphorst & Co., and John Robison. The letters concern the exchange between Ebeling (in Hamburg, Germany) and Bentley (in Salem, Massachusetts) of parcels containing books, newspapers, and manuscripts. The letters to Ebeling concern Silsbee, Robison, and Van Staphorts & Co. couriering or shipping books to or from Bentley. The letters have been disbound and the boards from the bound volume and the 1844 donor letter (from William Bentley Fowle to John Langdon Sibley) are housed at the end of the collection.  aColor digital facsimile available; see finding aid.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02157  aChristophe Daniel Ebeling Letters to William Bentley and Other Letters, 1795-1817 (MS Am 576).

He was born at Fochabers, Moray, Scotland, educated at the parish school at Fochabers and at King's College, Aberdeen. He went on to study law in Edinburgh and moved to Maryland in 1763 to practice law in Baltimore. As a devout loyalist, he returned to London in September of 1775 when revolutionary discontent grew in the American colonies. He was appointed chief clerk of the committee of the Privy Council for trade and foreign plantations. He held this post for 40 years, a position that allowed for abundant leisure time to spend on his studies, writings, and antiquary interests. He devoted his life to writing books about Ireland, affairs of America, and the British monarchy. He collected a vast library of books, original manuscripts, notes, and manuscript copies of documents used in his research.  aChalmers never married. When he died in London in 1825, his extensive library was bequeathed to his nephew. Upon the nephew's death in 1841, the library was sold in three parts between September 1841 and November 1842. For additional information concerning the library of George Chalmers, see: Messrs. Evans (Firm). Catalogue of the very curious, valuable and extensive library of the late George Chalmers...which will be sold by auction by Messrs.Evans... London: Evans, 1841-1842.  aCollection is predominantly Chalmers's notes and his manuscript transcriptions of documents. Some material is in the hand of George Chalmers, but not all. Types of materials included are copies of letters, financial records, reports, lists, as well as original research notes. Documents primarily concern exploration of North America, British relations with her colonies (especially America), trade and mercantilism, plantation life, the American Revolution and British loyalists claims, Irish concerns, and many other topics. Time period covered in these materials is 1507 through 1816, but the manuscript transcripts were probably produced circa 1760-1825.  aThere are papers of George Chalmers in the Jared Sparks Papers at the Houghton Library.

Correspondence; and II. Notes and clippings.  aPark Carpenter (1890-1967) was born in Northfield, Minnesota on May 5, 1890, the son of Clarence P. Carpenter and Lulu Mcelruth Carpenter. Carpenter earned an AM at Harvard College in 1917 and his LLB in 1922. He died in Plymouth, Massachusetts in August of 1967.  aAll materials concern the affairs of what is now the Dominican Republic, located on part of the island of Hispaniola, in the Caribbean region. Materials were assembled by Harvard University graduate student Park Carpenter, possibly for Carpenter's Harvard AM dissertation in history in 1917. Subjects in the materials span from ca.1844-1874, and primarily relate to the history of relations between the United States and the Dominican region, especially concerning the movement for the United States to annex the area.8 aCollection includes: typescript letters sent to Carpenter from various persons in response to his research inquiries to them; 1 letter from Carpenter; 5 autograph manuscript notebooks containing mostly chronologically arranged notes on the history of the Dominican area; and newsclippings from ca. 1869-1873. Carpenter appears to have been soliciting information from others concerning various persons involved in the annexation movement, especially information on William Leslie Cazneau, Senator Cornelius Cole, and many others who were prominent in Dominican affairs from 1844-1871. Some letters mention Harvard Professor Frederick Jackson Turner as a reference.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02187  aPark Carpenter Research Papers Concerning the Dominican Republic, 1869-1916 (MS Am 2736).

Porter prepared for college at Smith Academy in St. Louis, received an AB from Harvard College in 1892, received an L.L.B. from Washington University in St. Louis in 1894, and then entered the practice of law. In 1907 Valentine married Susan Creighton Williams (1877-1963), daughter of Meade Creighton Williams and Elizabeth Brown Riddle Williams. They had one child, Valentine Mott Porter Jr. (1915-2005). In August 1907, Valentine Sr. was taken seriously ill with septic pneumonia, which developed into tubercular trouble, and he was hurried to California where, with infrequent visits to the East and one trip abroad, he spent the rest of his life. Porter was a member of a variety of civic groups including: involvement as secretary of the Universal Congress of Lawyers and Jurists held in St. Louis in 1904; member of Associated Harvard Clubs of Indianapolis, University Club of St. Louis, Light Battery "A" Missouri Volunteers, and the Harvard Club of Santa Barbara. He edited the 1820 journal of Stephen Watts Kearny (1908) and wrote many other historical accounts. He died in Los Angeles, California in 1915 at age 44.

Rollins never married, died in 1958, and was buried in Abilene, Texas.  aThe bulk of these letters are from Harvard men who were taught by Rollins as undergraduates or doctoral students. Most of these students moved on to other universities to pursue academic careers in the field of literature. The bulk of letters are from the World War II time period (ca. 1944-1946) and primarily span topics of the war, military service, as well as their career concerns.  aSome folders were marked "From Harvard servicemen" and contain letters specifically about World War II military service. This designation was retained in the notes below. A few items have autograph annotations by Rollins.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou01871  aLetters sent to Hyder Edward Rollins (MS Am 2531).

Harley Farnsworth MacNair diaries; and II. Florence Wheelock Ayscough diaries.  aHarley Farnsworth MacNair (1891-1947) (HFM) was a Far East historian, the son of Douglad Evander MacNair and Nettie Adelia Farnsworth MacNair. He graduated from the University of Redlands with a Ph.B. degree in 1912. He went to Shanghai, China immediately after graduation and taught history at St. John's University. He stayed there until 1927, becoming professor of history and government in 1916, and head of the department in 1919. During this period he completed his MA at Columbia University in 1916 and received a Ph.D. in 1922 from the University of California at Berkeley. In 1927-1928 he returned to the United States and taught at the University of Seattle, then moved to the University of Chicago where he remained for the rest of his career teaching Far Eastern history. MacNair published voluminously, but he was especially known as a talented teacher.  aFlorence Wheelock Ayscough (1878-1942) (FWA) was born in Shanghai, China, the daughter of a Canadian business-man father and an American mother. She lived in China until she was eleven, when her parents returned to the United States. In her early twenties, she returned to China and eventually married Francis Ayscough, a British importer living in Shanghai. They periodically visited the U.S., while residing in China. FWA developed as a writer and a translator of Chinese poetry and eventually became a friend of the American poet, Amy Lowell, who she had first met in Boston when they were both girls. They worked together on various publishing projects, especially: Fir-flower tablets : poems translated from the Chinese / by Florence Asycough ; English versions by Amy Lowell. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1921. Francis Ayscough died in 1935 while they were living in Chicago. FWA married Harley MacNair shortly after, having originally met him in China in 1916. After their marriage, their home in Chicago became the gathering place for persons concerned with China.  aPrimarily autograph manuscript diaries concerning various time periods in both lives, but also includes loose materials such as letters, photographs, clippings, articles, pamphlets, and leaflets. Also includes photographs of Amy Lowell and autograph manuscript poems by Amy Lowell, Monadnock and Before dawn.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou01886  aHarley Farnsworth MacNair and Florence Wheelock Ayscough Diaries (MS Am 2549).

Musically active as a child, he learned songs from his mother’s many famous clients and showed an early talent for writing songs, having his first work published at age 15. He moved to London in 1913, and quickly became a favorite of Sir Edward Marsh, a well-known patron of the arts. He spent the first several years of his career working as a composer, but eventually added acting, both stage and film, to his repertoire. In the 1930s he composed and wrote a number of successful musicals, often partnering with Christopher Hassall. His work was immensely popular and his circle of friends included many famous film and stage actors, managers, and producers. Novello died at the age of 58.  aThe papers consist mostly of manuscript and typescript letters, with some manuscript and typescript compositions; including two letters in the hand of Ivor Novello. The bulk of the letters are to Ivor Novello from friends and fans, especially fellow theater performers, concerning Novello's shows and social events. The correspondence of Edward Marsh, Novello's long-time patron, includes letters concerning Novello's assignment to do performance propaganda for England in Stockholm and general personal letters which often mention Novello. Christopher Hassall's correspondence is chiefly about his inheritance from the Novello estate and royalties on work created with Novello. The compositions are largely about Novello, except for one piece, in French, about John Hassall. The papers also include further material about Novello's estate, including a list of borrowed artwork and notes from a meeting of trustees.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02177  aIvor Novello Papers, 1911-1956 (MS Thr 695).

In January 1970, Leary was sentenced to 20 years in a California state prison. In September of that year, with the help of the Weatherman, Leary escaped from prison and fled the country on a fake passport. He was apprehended and returned to prison in 1973.  aThis collection contains a composition written by Timothy Leary during his initial time in prison and letters to and from Leary while in prison and after his escape from prison. The correspondence concerns family matters, publishing issues, and some legal matters and includes some letters to or from Leary's wives, Rosemary Woodruff and Joanna Harcourt-Smith. Some envelopes show marks of having been inspected by prison officials. Also in the collection are some documents from Leary's time in prison and photographs of Leary, Woodruff, and Harcourt-Smith.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02384  aTimothy Leary Papers, 1967-ca. 1977 (MS Am 2880).

Canon John Solloway (1860-1946) was born in Chorley in Lancashire, England, where, in a church in a neighboring mansion, are arms of the Washington family. Solloway found this of great interest espcially when he later became a Canon of Yorkshire Cathedral, and then Vicar of Selby Abbey. At Selby Abbey he found a glass panel with arms that he recognized as Washington arms. Solloway then began a study of the Washingtons in England. According to Harvard historian A.B. Hart, as of 1931, Solloway "had the widest knowledge of any man in the world on that subject." Albert Bushnell Hart (1854-1943) was an American historian and professor at Harvard University. He worked as the official historian of the United States Commission for the Celebration of the Two Hundredth Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington in the 1920s and 1930s. Hart spent years making automobile tours through England in search of places connected with the English Washingtons. It was on one such tour where he met Solloway, acquired the manuscript of Solloway's The English Washingtons, which Hart describes as: "a very careful genealogy of the ancestors of George Washington in England." Hart proceeded to attempt to have this volume published, though it appears to have remained unpublished.  aIncludes autograph manuscripts (in notebook form) and correspondence.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou019028 aUnpublished printed finding aid available in the Houghton Accessions Records, 1944-1945, under *44M-367.  aJ.

During his apprenticeship, he attended classes at various art schools in London and traveled to France and Italy, where he was influenced by Post-impressionism and Cubism. For a time he was a member of the Omega Workshops, a design enterprise associated with the Bloomsbury group, and was involved in the British school of Futurism known as Vorticism. After serving in the First World War, his work dealt with the horrors of combat and social criticism in general. In his latter years, he turned to the documentation of urban life and portraiture.  aThe drawings that make up this collection were commissioned by T. E. Lawrence during 1925 and 1926, when an abridged version of Seven pillars of wisdom, entitled Revolt in the desert, proved financially successful, thus allowing work on a subscribers' edition of the original work to continue. None of the drawings in this collection were ultimately included; however, different illustrations by Roberts, chiefly portraits, were used.  aCollection includes original drawings in pen and ink, charcoal, chalk, and pencil. Many pieces have autograph manuscript annotations by Roberts. Some titles were given by Roberts; those supplied by the cataloger are given in square brackets.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02095  aWilliam Roberts Drawings for Seven Pillars of Wisdom (MS Eng 1653).

He was one of the founders of the Missouri Folklore Society organized in 1906 and helped them collect ballad text and music. In 1916-1917 he took a leave of absence to study at Harvard University, where he produced a complete copy of the Missouri ballad collection (prior to publication) to give to George Lyman Kittredge, Gurney Professor of English Literature, for placement in the Harvard Library. A comparison of this typescript (which forms the described collection in this finding aid) and Belden's later published 1940 ballad volume, shows "few major changes in arrangement ... [but] many versions of songs included in the 1917 collection were not published in 1940 ..." The actual publication of the entire set by Belden was delayed for various reasons until 1940 when he finally published: Ballads and songs collected by the Missouri folk-lore society, edited by H. M. Belden. Columbia: The University of Missouri, 1940.  aIncludes typescripts (some with manuscript revisions and annotations by Henry Marvin Belden and some by George Lyman Kittredge) of ballad and folk song text. Also includes manuscript music for some songs, editorial comments by Belden concerning the origin of the texts, names of persons responsible for recollecting and collecting the ballads, and the location and date when each version was transcribed.  aSelected color digital images available; see finding aid.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou01915  aHenry Marvin Belden Collection of Missouri Folk-Lore Society Ballads, Songs, Rimes, Games, Riddles, etc. Collected Between 1903 and 1917 (MS Am 2446).

Correspondence (A. Letters from Mrs. Patrick Campbell, B. Letters to Mrs. Patrick Campbell, C. Other correspondence); and II. Other material.  aBeatrice Rose Stella Tanner Campbell (1865-1940) was a prominent British actress. She made her debut as Mrs. Patrick Campbell in 1888 playing in a string of minor successes until an 1893 role as Paula in The second Mrs. Tanqueray launched her career and garnered high praise in the press. Mrs. Patrick is particularly remembered for her role as Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion, a part written for her by George Bernard Shaw, who began correspondence with her in 1899. Though begun at the close of the previous century, the correspondence between Shaw and Mrs. Patrick did not truly bloom until 1912. At that time, Shaw, the noted playwright, Fabian socialist, journalist, dramatic and literary critic, who had been married to fellow Fabian suffragist Charlotte Frances Payne-Townshend Shaw since 1898, pronounced himself to be "head over ears in love" with Mrs. Patrick. In 1914, when Mrs. Patrick, a widow of almost 15 years, was to marry George Cornwallis-West, Shaw implored her not to marry "that George." The marriage, combined with a souring experience for the two flirtatious friends in Sandwich (1913), seemed to dull the frequency of their correspondence until the 1920s when Mrs. Patrick introduced the idea of publishing their collected letters in her autobiographical work, My life and some letters. The correspondence, though less frequent through the years, continued to the end of Mrs. Patrick's life. Her will, written in 1934, stated her long-held desire that their correspondence be published in full. Shaw's will, dated the year of his death in 1950, granted long-withheld permission for the correspondence to be published to the financial benefit of Mrs. Patrick's great-grandchildren. The collection, edited by Alan Dent, Bernard Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell: their correspondence (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1952), included a significant selection, though not all, of the correspondence.  aThe largest part of this collection consists of letters written by Mrs. Patrick Campbell to George Bernard Shaw throughout the forty years of their relationship. Beginning in 1899 with Shaw’s first letter and carrying through to the end of Mrs. Patrick’s life in 1940, the two shared an early flirtatious relationship and reciprocal inspiration that perhaps most notably gave shape to the role of Eliza in Shaw’s Pygmalion. The letters between Shaw and Mrs. Patrick range widely, delving into the subjects of their active careers, family, health, emotions, travel, and their many significant theatrical and society acquaintances and friends. James Barrie, W.B. (William Bulter) Yeats, Dame Ellen Terry, Alfred and Edith Sophy Lyttelton, Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Sir Arthur Wing Pinero and Sir Henry Irving are mentioned with casual frequency. Politics is a notably absent theme.8 aA significant portion of the correspondence involves a specific and contentious topic for these writers: the publication of their letters. Publication exists not only as a theme of these letters, but as another framework through which they were actively read, both by Shaw and Mrs. Patrick, as well as others such as the editor of a 1952 volume of their correspondence, Alan Dent. Manuscript annotations and corrections by these parties litter the letters and are noted where applicable.8 aAlso included in this collection are two letters to friends Mr. and Mrs. Harry Lachman from Mrs. Patrick. Additionally, letters to Mrs. Patrick from her son, Alan Urquhart Campbell (“Beo”), various theatrical figures including George Arliss, Arnold Bennett, and Sir John Gielgud, and friends such as Daphne Du Maurier and Naomi Ellington Jacob are included. Typescript transcripts of Shaw’s letters and postcards to Mrs. Patrick as well as several letters from publishers and lawyers relating to the publication their correspondence round out the collection.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou00457  aMrs. Patrick Campbell Correspondence and Other Papers, 1901-1940 (MS Thr 372.1).

In this position, he organized a new Department of Public Works and established sanitary conditions in the city of Havana. Upon the arrival of General Leonard Wood, Black became Chief Engineer of the Island of Cuba. He wrote a code of regulations for the conduct of Public Works, which remained in force until they were incorporated into the laws of the new Cuban Republic. His establishment of public mapping, construction of sewers, paving of streets, construction of wharves, and the protection of the ocean-front established Havana as a viable seaport. [Source: www.spanamwar.com]. These photographs of the Spanish defenses were probably taken after the Spanish-American War (1898 April-August), prior to beginning the public works projects.  aPhotographs of Spanish colonial fortifications around Havana, Cuba including earthworks and buildings, such as barbed wire entanglements, batteries, block houses, pontoon bridges, redoubts, roads, standing trenches, and many other images.

Other formats present include a drypoint (print), passport, photographs, printed ephemera, and a will.  aRichard James Elliott (1907-1974) was born in Windsor (N.Y.) where his parents owned the Windsor Whip Company. He studied piano at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and attended Dartmouth College (B.A. in English, 1930) and the University of Pennsylvania (M.A. 1931). He subsequently taught at St. Andrew's in Tennessee where he befriended the reknowned teacher, Father James Harold Flye. Unhappy in teaching, Elliott took a post at the Brooklyn Public Library in 1937. He lived on Water Street in Brooklyn, earning a library science degree from Columbia University and associating with artists, writers, and musicians (many identified with the New York School), among them his neighbors, the writer and composer, Paul Bowles, and the set designer, Oliver Smith.  aElliott moved back to the family home in Windsor in 1947 to work on a novel, taking a position at the Harpur College Library. The publisher Alfred A. Knopf accepted a first draft of the novel but rejected the final version. Elliott published "9 Elaborations for 26 Characters" in Locus Solus (no. V, 1962) and a few other works, including a small volume of surrealist stories (A Song and a Diary for A) published shortly before his death. He remained in the historic family home; his health deteriorating after retirement in 1969, Elliott died in 1974.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02460  aIn English.  aRichard Elliott Papers, ca. 1924-1972 (MS Am 2934).

He graduated from Williams College in 1814 and Andover Theological Seminary in 1819 but declined a permanent pastorate, having unsettled views regarding theology. He was offered a pulpit in Gloucester (Mass.) which he accepted temporarily; thereafter he became a Unitarian and was appointed assistant to Dr. William Ellery Channing in Boston (Mass.). In 1823 he became pastor of the Unitarian Church in New Bedford (Mass.), remaining for ten years until travelling to Europe on account of his health. He took a position with the Unitarian Church of New York in 1835 but in 1842 his health again failed, occasioning a second trip to Europe from which he returned in 1844. He resigned his post in 1848 and retired to his farm in Sheffield where he prepared a series of lectures on the "Problem of Human Life and Destiny" for the Lowell Institute of Boston, a series repeated twice in New York and delivered in many other cities. This was followed by a second Lowell series in 1855 on the "Education of the Human Race," a series also widely repeated.  aClippings covering 12 lectures given by Dewey every three or four days from October 21-November 28, 1851, with the heading "The problem of human destiny: considered in its bearings on human life and welfare".  aClippings come from the Daily evening traveller, the American semi-weekly traveller, and/or the American weekly traveller (all variant editions published in Boston (Mass.)).  aWith a manuscript cover note in an unknown hand and another undated clipping entitled "Our age - the advancement of the age".  aIn English.  aMS Am 2746.

He is best remembered for compiling the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language, published in 1755. He was memorialized in James Boswell’s The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791). Hester Lynch Salusbury was born in Wales in 1741, and in 1763 married wealthy London brewer Henry Thrale. After the Thrales were introduced to Samuel Johnson in 1765, their home became the center of an important coterie of literary, artistic, and political figures.  aPredominantly letters written by Samuel Johnson to his stepdaughter Lucy Porter. Samuel Johnson never had children of his own and wrote fondly to his stepdaughter, who was the child of his deceased wife, Elizabeth Porter. The letters largely discuss his health and the concerns he has for Lucy's health. Other letters in the collection are from Hester Lynch Piozzi to the writer Charles Burney. They discuss the health of friends and family (including Samuel Johnson) who frequented Streatham Park, which Piozzi fancied a literary lodge of sorts. Also includes a letter from William Ridlington to Piozzi, seeking critical advice on his new law paper, and discusses current day literature.  aIn English.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou02467  aCollection is open for research.  aSamuel Johnson Additional Letters and Hester Lynch Piozzi Additional Correspondence, 1761-1803 (MS Eng 1754).

From 1940-1945 he worked as a jazz saxophonist in New York City; he studied at the Juilliard School of Music in 1945-1946. Rivers took up painting in 1945 and studied at the Hans Hofmann School from 1947–1948 at the encouragement of Nell Blaine. Rivers embarked on a trip to Paris in 1950 to write poetry and study paintings in the Louvre; Blaine joined him after a few weeks, renting a studio in order to paint. He went on to become a filmmaker and occasional actor and became associated with Pop Art and the New York School. Rivers died in 2002.

His father John Palfrey (1768-1843) was a merchant in Boston and later owned a plantation in Attakapas, La. John Gorham Palfrey's son, John Carver Palfrey (1833-1906) was a military engineer during the Civil War and was later an officer in the textile manufacturing business. His daughter Sarah Hammond Palfrey (1823-1914) was a novelist and poet.  aConsists chiefly of letters written by John Gorham Palfrey and by Charles Francis Adams. Letters written by John Gorham Palfrey include several to Ralph Waldo Emerson, concerning personal matters but with some references to Emerson's lectures, and some to various Palfrey family members concerning family matters and personal finances. Letters by Charles Francis Adams are addressed to John Gorham Palfrey and Sarah Hammond Palfrey, mostly regarding personal matters. One letter to Sarah explains his increasing indifference to poetry. Many letters are photocopies.  aSee also larger group of Palfrey family papers in bMS Am 1704.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou011150 aUnpublished printed finding aid available in the Houghton Accessions Records, 1962-1963, under *62M-96.  aPalfrey Family Correspondence, 1808-1913 (MS Am 2132).

Her family owned a hotel, Appledore House, and a cottage which became Celia's home and literary salon; both buildings burned in 1914. She often lived apart from her husband, Levi Lincoln Thaxter, and cared for her oldest son, Karl, until her death. This collection was apparently a gift for Rose Lamb, a friend and eventually co-editor of Thaxter's letters; the first photograph is inscribed to her.  aThe collection is comprised of fourteen photographs mounted on board and presented in a handsewn accordion-style cloth enclosure. There is one photograph of Celia Thaxter with her grandson, Charles Eliot Thaxter, and one portrait of five artist and musician friends (Appleton Brown, William Mason, John Knowles Paine, Ross Turner, and William Winch). The remaining photographs depict the interior and exterior of Thaxter's cottage and the surf. Several photographs have been inscribed by Thaxter.  aSelected color digital images available; see finding aid.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou001598 aUnpublished printed finding aid available in the Houghton Accessions Records, 1943-1944, under *43M-88-89.  aPhotographs of Celia Thaxter and Appledore Island (Me.)

Other correspondence with Quine (A. Correspondence concerning requests for permission to publish or for copies; B. Invitations to lecture, declined; C. Invitations to referee or serve on board, declined; D. Invitations to write, declined; E. Crank letters sent to Quine; F.

(Willard Van Orman) Quine (1908-2000) was an American mathematician, logician, and philosopher, widely considered one of the dominant figures in Anglo-American philosophy in the last half of the 20th century. He completed his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1932 and later became a junior fellow at Harvard and a member of the faculty in 1936. In 1948 he became a full professor at Harvard, holding the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy from 1956 until his retirement in 1978.0 aPapers include: professional correspondence and topical files; crank letters; requests for permission to publish Quine writings; declined invitations sent to Quine to lecture, referee, serve on a board, and write; Quine's notes and compositions for lectures, books, articles, teaching and work from his own student years; collected compositions written by others, most with annotations by Quine; biographical miscellany; and ephemera, clippings, and photographs.  aAlso includes restricted files including: Quine's recommendations written for others along with resumes and correspondence; files about students; correspondence concerning the recommending and selection of candidates for teaching positions, awards, etc...; and some Harvard University departmental files.  aSeries I, the large, general correspondence series, includes many prominent correspondents in the world of 20th-century philosophy, and much conversation about departments at Harvard University and various philosophical societies and journals. Also, mixed within this series, are topical folders including letters and information about the main entry. It should be noted that Quine's correspondence often contained philosophical proofs, logical and mathematical symbols, and other philosophical expressions that appear more like working papers for his writings than simple letters. Many of the names featured in this correspondence series, also have entries in Series III, Compositons by others.  aA few of the correspondents included in series I are: American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Association, Association for Symbolic Logic, A. J. (Alfred Jules) Ayer, Rudolf Carnap, Noam Chomsky, Alonzo Church, Donald Davidson, Burton Dreben, Herbert Feigl, Dagfinn Føllesdal, Philipp Frank, P. T. (Peter Thomas) Geach, Roger F. Gibson, Nelson Goodman, Carl Gustav Hempel, Saul A. Kripke, Ernest LePore, Bryan Magee, Ruth Barcan Marcus, Charles W. (Charles William) Morris, Ernest Nagel, Jean Piaget, Charles Parsons, Michael Polanyi, Sir Karl Raimond Popper, Hilary Putnam, John Rawls, Richard Rorty, Bertrand Russell, Gilbert Ryle, B. F. (Burrhus Frederic) Skinner, J. J. C. (John Jamieson Carswell) Smart, P. F. Strawson, Alfred Tarski, Jean Van Heijenoort, Hao Wang, Alfred North Whitehead, J. O. (John Oulton) Wisdom, and many, many others.  aQuine's compositions include: his own early course work and notes on classes taken at Oberlin College and at Harvard University; notes from later years; teaching materials, especially lectures materials for courses at Harvard; lecture materials for occasional lectures; and appointment calendars, clippings on his life, and a few other personal or family related items. There is very little personal correspondence, photographs or papers, as these were retained by the Quine family.8 aThe final series, papers found with his books primarily concern or are related to Quine's trip to Japan in December 1996 to receive the Inamori Foundation's Kyoto Prize for lifetime achievement in creative arts and moral sciences. Also included is a printed book of poems kept and annotated by Quine from 1913-1922.  aSelected color digital images available; see finding aid.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou01800  aW.

At Harvard, he edited the Advocate with T. S. Eliot who became a lifelong friend. Aiken was influenced in his early poetry by his teacher, the philosopher George Santayana.  aWhile living in England from 1921 until the outbreak of WWII, Aiken was mentor to the English author Malcolm Lowry.

Among its stated purposes was "to cherish the memories and associations of the war" and to "strengthen the ties of fraternal fellowship and sympathy formed by companionship-in-arms." The Commandery of the State of Massachusetts was instituted on 1868 March 4. Activities included social gatherings; the presentation of historical papers on the war; and the collection of books, manuscripts, photographs, and memorabilia.  aMany of the images are copy prints of well-known prints and photographs of soldiers, battlefields, and other Civil War subjects. The collection also includes some unique images, such as original drawings of Civil War vessels by artist Worden Wood; drawings of battlefields made shortly after the war, apparently by a veteran of the 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment; post-war photographs of battlefields showing veterans of the 13th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment; and reproductions of drawings of war-era North Carolina, apparently by a member of the 44th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. Images include the following genres: cartes-de-visite, cabinet photographs, clippings, engravings, tintypes, copy prints, drawings, lithographs, photomechanical prints, negative prints, sketches, and watercolors.  aManuscripts include original letters, diaries, regimental documents, and other papers relating to the Civil War. Highlights include a substantial archive of the papers of Thomas Wentworth Higginson, commander of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, the first predominantly African-American regiment in the Civil War; research files of Daniel Eldredge on the history of the 3rd New Hampshire Infantry Regiment; Augustus C. Hamlin's extensive correspondence files on Andersonville Prison and the Battle of Chancellorsville; extensive documentation of the antebellum South and of the Confederate States of America; wartime correspondence of Union generals Gustave Paul Cluseret, George Nelson Macy, James Birdseye McPherson, George Duncan Wells, and Edward Augustus Wild; a diary and wartime correspondence of Private John M. Haines of the 3rd New Hampshire Infantry Regiment; original manuscript wartime diaries of Robert H. Gray of the 4th Maine Infantry Regiment, William Ware Hall of the 5th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery Regiment, Wesley T. Harris and Ezra Brown Peabody of the 3rd New Hampshire Infantry Regiment, Henry A. Tracy of the 1st Massachusetts Light Artillery Battery and John G. Wiggin of the 11th Massachusetts Light Artillery Battery; and extensive documentation relating to the 12th, 20th, 31st, 35th, and 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiments, 1st New York Engineer Regiment, 1st South Carolina Volunteers, and United States Sanitary Commission. The collection also features an eclectic collection of pre-war and post-war manuscripts, including two significant manuscripts signed by Filipino independence leader Emilio Aguinaldo, post-war correspondence of General Winfield Scott Hancock, and memoirs by numerous former Civil War officers.  aPrinted material includes ephemera relating to the Civil War such as blank forms, broadsides, clippings, leaflets, printed orders, and sheet music; and a subseries of complete copies of newspapers, mostly from the Civil War period.  aMilitary Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States Commandery of the State of Massachusetts Civil War Collection, 1724-1933 (MS Am 1084).

Also includes bylaws and minutes of the company, souvenir programs and playbills, two scrapbooks of clippings including reviews, three photographs, an illustrated historical review of the theatre, and an original electric light bulb from Edison's incandescent system.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou015798 aUnpublished printed finding aid available in the Harvard Theatre Collection, under *2003MT-130.  aBoston Bijou Theatre Company Records, 1882-1927 (MS Thr 432).

Audio recordings.  aStella Bloch was born in Poland between 1897 and 1899 to a Polish-born emigrant mother who had been living in New York and returned there to raise her daughter. Inspired by an Isadora Duncan performance in 1914, Bloch began her earliest training with Duncan's first group of students, the Isadorables. As an adolescent, Bloch took art classes from the Art Students League of New York, and began drawing and documenting dance and dancers. Bloch married Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy, curator of Indian and Muhammadan Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the couple toured the Far East, where Bloch studied the dances of Bali, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, and Java. Upon her return to Boston and New York, Bloch gave performances of Javanese dance and lectures on life in the Far East. She wrote articles for magazines, and was featured in newspapers and magazines as well. She published a book, Dancing and the Drama East and West (Orientalia, 1922), which contrasted Eastern theater with Western theater. The book also included some of Bloch's sketches from Bali, Cambodia, China, and Java. Bloch had many exhibitions of her artwork, primarily in New York but also in California, where she and her second husband, the lyricist Edward Eliscu, lived for a few years.  aThe collection consists of selected essays and articles written by Bloch on subjects ranging from Isadora Duncan to philosophy to Eastern (Balinese, Cambodian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Javanese) dance and culture; artwork by Bloch featuring Duncan dancers, dancers and other performers in the Far East, and performers during the Harlem Renaissance; photographs of various subjects, including Balinese, Chinese, Javanese, and Kathakali dancers, the Eastman Theatre in Rochester, New York, chorus girls from the Harlem jazz scene, Nyota Inyoka, Ethel Barrymore, and portraits of Bloch in various costumes and genres, including Duncan, Spanish, Javanese, and flapper poses; and newspaper and magazine reviews featuring Bloch. The bulk of the material covers from the late 1910s through the Harlem Renaissance.8 aAlso includes correspondence to, from, and regarding Bloch, notably Nyota Inyoka, George Cukor, and R. H. Macy & Co.; publicity and programs for Bloch's performances and exhibitions; subject files on people and events of significance to Bloch; and audio recordings of jazz music. There is almost no material on Bloch's family (parents, husbands, children) or early education; the correspondence series covers only the earliest years of Bloch's career. While the artwork included in this collection contains nudes and portraits, it mainly consists of dancers and performers. Bloch used as her subjects Duncan dancers, Eastern dancers, New York City Ballet dancers, and most notably dancers, singers, and musicians of the Harlem Renaissance.  aMaterials in English and French.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou014558 aUnpublished finding aid available in the Harvard Theatre Collection, 2003-2004, under *2003MT-231.  aStella Bloch Papers, 1914-1991 (MS Thr 460).

Garrison Jr.'s correspondence is both personal and professional, including 201 letters to his sister Fanny Garrison Villard and 90 to his brother-in-law Henry Villard on business matters. The largest body of correspondence, that of Wendell Phillips Garrison, contains personal correspondence with family and friends and professional correspondence concerning The Nation. Letters to Fanny are mostly condolence letters on the death of her brother Wendell. Much of the third party correspondence concerns the celebration honoring Wendell's forty years at The Nation, or consists of letters to Elizabeth Pease Nichol, an English abolitionist. Manuscripts are mostly lectures by Wendell or notes of W. L. Garrison Sr. Also contains legal documents, photographs, genealogies, clippings, ephemera, and printed material including books and pamphlets by or about W. L. Garrison Sr. or Wendell Phillips Garrison.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou006738 aUnpublished printed finding aid available in the Houghton Accessions Records, 1972-1973, under *72M-101.  aGarrison Family Papers (MS Am 1906).

Toy theaters, cutouts, models, and paper dolls; and II. Miscellany for toy theaters.  aToy theaters were especially popular as English children's toys in the first half of the 19th-century. They were also called paper theaters and model theaters. By the late 19th-century popularity waned and publishing of these materials declined. Individual character portrait prints known as "penny plains" and "twopence coloureds" were collected and often used in toy theaters, as were engraved prints of multiple characters and scenery. Performing scripts were written especially for children to be used with these materials.  aPrimarily reproductions of early 19th-century toy theater material, but some were newly designed and manufactured in the 20th-century. Collection contains toy theaters manufactured in Germany, Spain, England, the United States, and Denmark, including full cardboard and wooden theaters, prosceniums, stage floors, cloth curtains, scenery, characters, character slides, printed scripts, an audiocassette, and paper wrappers. Also includes cutouts, models, a set of electric lights for a toy theater, plastic and wooden toy figures, stencils, and paper dolls. Companies and individuals associated include: McLoughlin Bros., D'Oyly Carte, Mike Bartley, C. B. Nualart (El Teatro de los Niños), Pollock's Toy Theatres, Theatre Museum (Victoria and Albert Museum), Walt Disney Company, and many others.

The classical ballets were reproduced by Nikolai Sergeev from the choreographic scores brought out of Russia by Sergeev. The company performed primarily in and around London, often taking ballet to towns not visited by other companies.

Biographical material.  aVera Zorina (1917-2003) was a ballet dancer, a movie and musical theater actress, a choreographer, and an opera director. She was born Eva Brigitta Hartwig in Berlin on January 2, 1917. She was married to George Balanchine from 1938 to 1946. After divorcing him she married composer and CBS artistic director Goddard Lieberson (1911-1977) with whom she had two sons, composer Peter Lieberson (1946-2011) and philosopher, writer and journalist Jonathan Lieberson (1949-1989). Her third marriage was to harpsichordist Paul Wolfe. Upon her second marriage she left the stage, but returned in the 1950s as a performer and opera narrator. In the 1960s Zorina directed opera productions at Santa Fe and the New York City Opera, as well as in Oslo, Norway.

Ticknor and Fields originated in the firm of Allen and Ticknor, established in 1832. The partners in Ticknor and Fields were William D. Ticknor (one of the partners in Allen and Ticknor) and James T. Fields, who entered the firm as a junior partner in 1843. After a series of changes, Ticknor and Fields evolved into Houghton, Mifflin and Company. The succession of corporate names was as follows: Allen and Ticknor (1832-1834); William D. Ticknor (1834-1843); William D. Ticknor and Co. (1843-1849); Ticknor, Reed and Fields (1849-1854); Ticknor and Fields (1854-1868); Fields, Osgood and Co. (1868-1871); James R. Osgood and Co. (1871-1878); Houghton, Osgood and Co. (1878-1880); Houghton, Mifflin and Co. (1880-1908); and Houghton Mifflin Co. (since 1908). Henry Oscar Houghton began as a printer in Cambridge, Mass. and established H. O. Houghton and Co. in 1852. Houghton's printing establishment on the Charles River in Cambridge was known as the Riverside Press. In 1864 he formed a publishing partnership in the firm of Hurd and Houghton. In 1878 the business merged with James R. Osgood and Co. as Houghton, Osgood and Co.  aRecords of Houghton Mifflin and its predecessors, containing papers relating to both the printing and publishing branches of the business. Includes a voluminous file of incoming letters, chiefly post-1870, from authors published by the firm; some correspondence with other publishers; a few compositions; and a small file of editorial correspondence of The Atlantic Monthly.  aIncludes 2 drawing illustrations by Frances Lester Warner: At home with variations; and Sunlight sonata, Family life with variations. Also 3 pen and ink drawing illustrations by Warner: Geoffrey went politely to the edge of the roof, and gazed down, from Fire in the sky; and From Diet and the Daily Dozen Exercise, said Endicott, is not at its best without a by-product...  aHoughton Mifflin Company Correspondence and Records (MS Am 1925-1925.4).

In 1813 Harvard appointed him Dexter Lecturer on Biblical Criticism and in 1819 he was appointed the first Dexter Professor of Sacred Literature. He also acted as the College Librarian from 1813 to 1821. In 1821 he married Catharine Eliot who brought him wealth and a Cambridge estate called "Shady Hill." Norton, known as the "Unitarian Pope," was Emerson's leading foe in the Unitarian-Transcendentalist controversy. He spent his last years in deteriorating health and died in Newport, Rhode Island in 1853. Andrews and Catharine Norton had four children who survived infancy; one was scholar, critic, and Harvard professor, Charles Eliot Norton.  aCorrespondence and letter books of Andrews Norton, including family correspondence and letters reflecting Norton's scholarly interests and his work as librarian and professor at Harvard; together with some manuscripts of writings by Norton; undergraduate diary from Norton's student days at Harvard; daguerreotype of Norton; diary, 1818-1819; notebooks; notes on reading and catalogue of Norton's books; and clippings.

After a series of changes within each firm, Ticknor and Fields and the Riverside Press merged together in 1878 to become Houghton, Osgood, and Company. Two years later, James R. Osgood left the partnership and George Harrison Mifflin and Henry Oscar Houghton formed Houghton, Mifflin, and Company. In 1908, Houghton, Mifflin and Company changed from a partnership to a corporation as the Houghton Mifflin Company. The company became publicly owned in 1967 and was bought by the French conglomerate, Vivendi Universal SA, in 2001. The succession of corporate names in the period covered by this correspondence is: Houghton, Mifflin and Co. (1880-1908); and Houghton Mifflin Company (since 1908).  aCorrespondence is between Houghton Mifflin Company and the authors they published. Houghton Mifflin Company editors and staff include Paul Brooks, Ferris Greenslet, and Robert Newton Linscott, among others. Authors include Ansel Adams, James Agee, Isaac Asimov, Elizabeth Bishop, Rachel Carson, John Dos Passos, Martha Foley, Esther Forbes, John Kenneth Galbraith, John Howard Griffin, Archibald MacLeish, Carson McCullers, Roger Tory Peterson, H.A. (Hans Augusto) Rey, Arthur Meier Schlesinger, and many others.

Thereafter he continued to teach compartive literature and Russian studies at a variety of educational institutions and was deeply involved in progressive political activities, particularly in advancing the cause of global socialism and supporting labor unions and worker education.

The bulk of his literary oeuvre focused on Soviet drama; he also wrote a history of the Dana family, The Dana saga, and produced an edition of the novel of his paternal grandfather, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Two years before the mast. Beginning in 1917, Dana was granted life tenancy of the Vassall-Craigie-Longfellow House at 105 Brattle St., Cambridge, Mass. and became its first curator when the residence was made a national monument and research center administered by the US National Park Service.  aIncludes correspondence from Henri Barbusse, Bartolomeo Vanzetti, and others to Dana; articles and speeches by Dana on the Sacco-Vanzetti case and on Barbusse; speeches by Barbusse; clippings on Barbusse, socialism, and pacifism during the inter-war years; drawings and photographs of Barbusse.  aCollection materials are predominantly in English and French; some in Russian.  aHenry Wadsworth Longfellow Dana Papers on Henri Barbusse and Sacco-Vanzetti (MS Am 2615).

Between December 1849 and June 1850 the United States Senate received 271 petitions from the citizens of various states urging the end of flogging. In September 1850 Congress abolished flogging in the Navy and merchant marine. On 3 March 1851, the commutation of the liquor ration was restricted to "officers and their attendants" only. On 31 August 1853, Congress repealed the 1851 law and the liquor privilege was once again opened up to the rank and file. Source: Website of the U.S. Navy Department Library.  aThese papers are letters, statements, and petitions that are responses to Haynes' initiative to change the regulations of the United States Navy that permited corporal punishment (especially flogging) and allowed alcohol as part of the men's rations.

Polly Carter (d.1872) originally lived on "Master Warner's" plantation in Gloucester County, Virginia, with her husband and two children, Albert and Alexander. Another son, Hamilton Carter, resided in nearby Richmond and was either a bondsman or a free man. During the Civil War Hamilton was employed as dining room servant to Henry C. Beuce, the proprietor of Irving Mills. In October of 1866, Hamilton was hired by Dr. George Ross, a prominent Richmond physician. In 1871 Hamilton married an African-American woman, Martha Glenn, who was originally also from Richmond. They had 6 children: Cassie, Alize, Pierce, Hamilton, Jr., Mattie, and one child who died in 1881. The family lived for many years in a home they owned on the corner of 9th and Abigail Streets in the Madison Ward section of Richmond.

In 1930, they donated these papers to Harvard College Library. The Rogers Memorial Room on the top floor of Widener Library was set aside to house the collection, and opened in 1935. The Rogers Memorial Room was relocated to the Harvard Theatre Collection's space in Lamont Library in 1949. Building renovations required that the room be vacated in 2006, but the Rogers Memorial Collection is still maintained as a unified whole.  aThis collection consists of records kept by the Harvard Theatre Collection concerning the administration of the Rogers Memorial Collection, including bookplates, catalog cards, inventories, memoranda, a rubber stamp, and a visitors' book, as well as papers concerning the publication of "The Rogers Memorial Room. An Account of the Nature, Origin, and Significance of the Memorabilia Presented to Harvard College in 1930 by Clara Kathleen and Henry Munroe Rogers" ([Boston] : Cosmos Press, 1935).0 aThe Rogers Memorial Collection, of which this is Series IX, contains literary and historical material relating to mid-nineteenth-century America and memorabilia concerning the English composer John Barnett (1802-1890).

Photographs of female opera performers; II. Photographs of male opera performers; and III. Other Chicago opera photographs.  aThis collection is made up of photographs that are stamped with a variety of property stamps from groups who performed opera in Chicago, Illinois from about 1910 to 1932. The items that are actually dated are from 1916-1923, but research indicates there are earlier and later images: Chicago Grand Opera Company began performing in the fall of 1910 and was the first resident opera company in Chicago. The last performance was in the spring of 1914; Chicago Opera Association established in 1915 and continued until 1922; Chicago Civic Opera formed in 1922 and folded at the end of the 1931-1932 season.  aCollection consists mainly of 10 x 8 inch black and white photographs of Chicago operatic performers. Most images have text on their versos, either stamped in ink or in manuscript hand, stating the name of performer, opera and role depicted in image, and company producing the opera. Most items are undated. Singers are primarily in character and usually solo, though there are a few depicting multiple persons in one image, and a few images in street clothes.8 aAlso included are a few photographs of conductors and directors of the operas. A few photographs are included of: scenes from The Marriage of Figaro, and the exterior and interior views of the Civic Opera House (Chicago).8 aPhotographic studios include: Chicago Architectural Photo Company, Daguerre (Chicago), Fernand de Gueldre (Chicago), H.

Mary Austin's letters compliment Bynner's works and contain critical interpretations of their peer's works. The correspondence from Willa Cather divulges information about her youth as the starting point for her knowledge of western life. Frost's letters are personal in nature and inquire about family life while reminiscing on past encounters. Many letters from Laurence Housman discuss his own works, particularly the creation of his brother's (A.E. Housman) Memoirs. Laurence often discusses American politics, particulary the Second World War.

He was educated at the Lycée Henry IV and at the Ecole des Beaux Arts where he met Neville Lytton, who became a close friend. In 1907, Geoffroy-Dechaume and his wife, Geneviève, went to live in England near Crabbet Park, the home of Lytton and his wife, Judith. Although exempt from military service, Geoffroy-Dechaume returned to France in 1914 to join the army as a volunteer. He was wounded in his first engagement which resulted in the loss of his leg. He returned to the front with the British as a "peintre des Armées." After the war, Geoffroy-Dechaume and his family moved to Valmondois, Seine et Oise, but kept up a steady correspondence with his English acquaintances. His paintings can be found in galleries in Britain and France, including the War Museum, the Fitzwilliam, and the Royal Collection. Geoffroy-Dechaume died at Valmondois in 1944.  aThis collection contains letters and postcards to Charles Geoffroy-Dechaume and to Geneviève Geoffroy-Dechaume from various correspondents, from the Geoffroy-Dechaumes to Sydney Cockerell and Dorothy Walker and others, and between the Geoffroy-Dechaume children and the Cockerell family and Dorothy Walker.

It was opened on June 14, 1841. The Boston Museum Stock Company gave its first performance on September 4, 1843, and thereafter remained one of the nation's finest ensembles. The Stock Company's favorite performers were William Warren, who first acted there in 1847, and Mrs. J. R. Vincent, but at one time or another in its long career many great artists of the era appeared, either as members of the troupe or as guest stars. The subterfuge of housing a theater in a museum was not uncommon, for it allowed many otherwise puritanical people to enjoy play-going. The theatre closed in 1893, the museum in 1903. Kate Ryan Nolan (born 1857) was a Boston stage actress with the Boston Museum Stock Company. She married actor James Nolan in 1873. She wrote a memoir in 1915: "Old Boston Museum Days."  aPrimarily cabinet photographs of Kate Ryan, James Nolan, George Wilson and other actors from the Boston Museum Stock Company. Some images are "in-character" and some are in street clothes. Also includes a few photographic prints. Some images were used as illustrations for Ryan's 1915 memoir, "Old Boston Museum Days."  aIn English.  aBoston Museum Stock Company Kate Ryan Nolan Collection of Photographs (MS Thr 629).

Blanck was a friend and colleague of Ernie Wessen.  aThe bulk of this collection is correspondence between bibliophiles Blanck and Wessen, documenting a thiry-year personal friendship and professional relationship. During most of this time (1950-1974), Blanck's BAL project was housed at Harvard University in the Houghton Library. The letters are chatty, frank, quite personal, and full of detailed information and comments on the antiquarian book trade, both business and people. Some of the additional letters included here were sent to Blanck by Wessen, detailing what Wessen thought were his amusing, though often controversial, interactions with collectors and other dealers.  aOther materials included are clippings, photographs, radio scripts, and essays about Wessen, as well as issue no. 89 of Wessen's rare materials catalog, Midland Notes, a few of Blanck's typescript essays, and microopaque card samples of Midland Notes.  aErnest James Wessen Correspondence with Jacob Blanck (MS Am 2541).

Compositions.  aAmerican essayist and editor, Dennie (Harvard College A.B. 1790) wrote for weekly papers in Walpole, N.H., Boston, Mass., and Philadelphia, Pa. He was closely associated with the Farmer's Weekly Museum of Walpole, for which he wrote "Lay Preacher" which under his editorship (1796- ) became a strong Federalist organ read throughout the union; and The Port Folio, a weekly devoted to literature and politics which he established in 1801 in Philadelphia with bookseller Asbury Dickins. This magazine was considered without rival until the founding of the North American Review in 1815.  aThe bulk of the collection is letters to Dennie from literary and political colleagues; readers and subscribers of his various newspapers, especially the Farmer's Museum; and his Harvard classmates during his rustication, 1790, when he lived under a chaplain's supervision in Groton, Mass. Letters by Dennie are mostly to his parents and contain detailed accounts of his life from his school days throughout his career. Manuscripts consist of essays, poems, verse translations, college and school notes and exercises, and fragments by Dennie. Includes an original manuscript of his first Farrago essay. Third-party correspondence is mostly to his mother, much of it after his death.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou00108  aJoseph Dennie Papers, 1783-1815 (MS Am 715).

From Warren, the mother and daughter moved to New York City where they lived together until Mrs. von Zastrow’s death in 1938. Miss von Zastrow apparently never married. Among other activities, Miss von Zastrow was an actress, which is likely how she and Mrs. Patrick met one another. The two played together in some productions.

Manuscript transcripts of Phineas Parkhurst Quimby writings; and II. Other papers.  aPhineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802-1866) was a New England mesmerist, teacher, and mental healer who lived in Belfast, Maine. He developed an original healing philosophy related to mesmerism and Swedenborgianism which essentially was "a belief system that included the tenet that illness originated in the mind as a consequence of erroneous beliefs and that a mind open to God's wisdom could overcome any illness." Upon his death Quimby left behind only loosely organized and unpublished manuscripts which were later publicized by his patient-disciples, especially Annetta Seabury Dresser, Julius Dresser, and Warren Felt Evans, who developed Quimby's teachings into the New Thought or Mind Cure philosophy. A fourth disciple, Mary Baker Eddy, transformed her interpretation of the Quimby manuscripts into the basis for the Church of Christ, Scientist. Quimby is thought by some to have been the first secular psychotherapist to practice in the United States. Source: Robert C. Fuller.

The case of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Sacco and Vanzetti quickly became one of America's most complicated and notorious political trials. They were found guilty on July 14, 1921, but the legal struggle to save them extended until 1927. By April 9, 1927, all appeals in the Massachusetts courts had failed and the men were sentenced to death. Alvan T. Fuller, the governor of Massachusetts, appointed a three person advisory committee to look into the case. The committe was known as the "Lowell Commission," so-called because the most prominent member was A. Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard University. Other members of the commitee were Judge Robert A. Grant and Massachusetts Institute of Technology president Samuel Stratton. In its report of July 27, 1927, the committee decided that clemency was not warranted and the governor refused to commute the sentences. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed on August 23, 1927.  aIncludes: complete typescript carbon of the 1921 trial and motion for new trial transcripts, prepared for A. Lawrence Lowell for his work on the Lowell advisory committee; two copies of the committee procedings of July 14-21, 1927; letters from Governor Alvan T. Fuller to Lowell conveying documents and outlining the committee work; 2 telegrams from Sacco and Vanzetti supporters sent to the committee; and other transcripts from the first trial.0 aElectronic finding aid availableuhttp://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Hough:hou01789  aA.
